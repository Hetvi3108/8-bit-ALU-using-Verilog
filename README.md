# 8-bit-Complex-number-ALU-using-Verilog 🔢⚙️

This project implements a **Complex Number Arithmetic Operator** using **Verilog**. It supports various arithmetic and analytical operations on complex numbers including:

- Addition ➕  
- Multiplication ✖️  
- Division ➗  
- Conjugate calculation  
- Angle (argument) determination  

All operations are implemented at the **gate level** using modules such as AND, OR, XOR, NAND gates, half adders, and full adders, with 8-bit precision.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular and reusable Verilog design
- Gate-level implementation (no `assign` statements)
- Handles **signed and unsigned** inputs
- Verified using extensive testbenches
- Applications in signal processing, robotics, and control systems
